## About Me
Hi! My name is Komal and I am a senior at Hunter College in NYC. I am majoring in computer science and psychology. I love cats and listen to music on a daily basis. I love plants so I enjoy hiking and running outdoors. I also am a big foodie and love spicy noodles. I recently tried korean corndogs, the cheese and potato one, 10/10!!
